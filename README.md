# Cleanup
I was interested in working on a Minecraft client named "Xulu." I have a fondness for this client and aim to refine the code, as the structure is really good but the existing code is somewhat disorganized / Messy. The source code (SRC) is buildable; however, I strongly advise against using this base in its current form.

# How to Build?
- Download the zip or clone the repository.
- Open the command prompt in the main folder.
- Use the command "gradle setupdecompworkspace," and after that, use "gradle b" to build the JAR.

# How to Use It?
- Place the generated JAR file in your mods folder (which you should have by now) located in your ".minecraft" folder.
